## Abstract

Malware aims to stay undetected for as long as possible.
One common method for avoiding or delaying detection is the use of
code injection, by which a malicious process injects code into another
running application. Despite code injection being known as one of the
main features of todayâ€™s malware, it is often overlooked and no prior
research performed a comprehensive study to fundamentally understand
and measure code injection in Windows malware. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of code injection techniques and propose the first
taxonomy to group these methods into classes based on common traits.
Then, we leverage our taxonomy to implement models of the studied
techniques and collect empirical evidence for the prevalence of each spe-
cific technique in the malware scene. Finally, we perform a large-scale,
longitudinal measurement of the adoption of code injection, highlighting
that at least 9.1% of Windows malware between 2017 and 2021 performs
code injection. Our systematization and results show that Process Hollowing is the most commonly used technique across different malware
families, but, more importantly, this trend is shifting towards other, less
traditional methods. We conclude with takeaways that impact how future malware research should be conducted. Without comprehensively
accounting for code injection and modeling emerging techniques, future
studies based on dynamic analysis are bound to limited observations.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured in the following manner:

- `src`: Contains all the source code required to run the samples, analyze them individually as well as collectively. It also contains various sample implementations of the studied code injection techniques.
- `data`: Contains the resulting reports, sample hashes and detected code injection techniques.

In the individual directories you can find README files with further information specifically.
